 ## :page_with_curl: Description
  
This project was developed in order to automate the production and delivery pipeline of a code already provided. 


With GithubActions, all tests of the application are checked whenever a PullRequest is opened to avoid any
errors going to the main repository. In addition, whenever a code goes to the main repository, the deployment in AWS is automatic, also with the use of githubActions.
Besides that, the deployment was done with the help of the Nginx web server and the docker service.
